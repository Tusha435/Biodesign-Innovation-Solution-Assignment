## 1. Project Overview
The project aims to identify important factors and build predictive models for colon cancer diagnosis based on patients' clinical data and tumor characteristics. We use two datasets, dataset_1 and dataset_2, which contain both numerical and categorical features, for a comprehensive analysis and modeling process.

## 2. Dependencies
